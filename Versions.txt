Version 1 
	deals with simple ray traing with no generalities and eye is fixed on Z axis and can be moved only on Z axis
	1. ver1.h
	2. ray1.cpp

Version 2
	this version adds the generality to the positioning on eye at any point in 3D space by using 
	a mapping between local coordinate axis of eye (n,u,v) and global (x,y,z) coordinates...
	1. ver2.h
	2. ray2.cpp
	
version 3
	this version adds the the ability to trace multiple objects (spheres) in the scene....
	1. ver3.h
	2. ray3.cpp
	
version 4
	this version includes the phong model for lighting  + the material color properties + multiple light sources...
	1. ver4.h
	2. ray4.cpp
	
version 5
	things to be included in this version:
	coordinate axes corrected
	1. planer object 
	2. make interfaces of already existing class / eliminate the need of friend classes
	files-
	1.ver5.h
	2.ray5.cpp
	
version 6
	updates from previous version:
	1. corrected shading model (phong)
	2. secondary ray tracing (shadow, reflection, refraction)
