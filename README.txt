of light sources.

Ver.h files are the header files having classes 
ray.cpp are the files having inplementation details of these classes
Scene.txt are the scene files, which are used to set up camera, objects and lights in
the scene.

for different versions of ray tracer refer to "Versions.txt",
for help regarding how to write scene files refer to SDL.txt


to compile and run the code fr a articular version of ray tracer,
  - pick any of the ver.h file from 6 different version
